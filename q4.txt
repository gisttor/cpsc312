To allow the user to set the top level goal from the interpreter loop, assertz(rule(top_goal(X), [attr(is_a, X, [])])). was removed from the clear_db predicate and a new predicate was created:

goal :-
  write('Enter the new goal, followed by a period: '),
  read_sentence(Y),
  process(['goal:'|Y]).

Example:
?- goal.
Enter the new goal, followed by a period: what the heck is THAT.
Understood: rule(top_goal(_G312),[attr(is_a,_G312,[])]) 
true.

?- solve.
