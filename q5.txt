To allow the user to assert new facts and rules we simply create a new predicate:

new_rule :-
  write('Enter a new rule, followed by a period: '),
  read_sentence(Y),
  process(['rule:'|Y]).

Example:

?- new_rule.
Enter a new rule, followed by a period: if its neck is medium then it is goose.
Understood: if it has medium neck then it is goose 
true.

?- goal.
Enter the new goal, followed by a period: what is it.
Understood: rule(top_goal(_G288),[attr(is_a,_G288,[])]) 
true.

?- solve.
