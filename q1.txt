The domain choosen is a tiny subset of the countries of the World. The database can identify four countries, Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, Suriname and Canada by some very simple features.

The only problem encounterd while creating the database was properly formating the rules and identifying the word types of each word. This was a small hump to get over for someone who is not a native speaker but after that, creating the database was straight forward.

The word type definitions that we needed to add to 312-pess-grammer.pl were:

n(type).
n(paraguay).
n(coastline).
n(bolivia).
n(brazil).
n(suriname).
n(canada).

adj(enclosed).
adj(landlocked).
adj('not-landlocked').
adj('bordered-by-peru').
adj('south-american').
adj(big).
adj(small).
adj(independent).
